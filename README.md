# IDK-hackathon-project
 Developed during a VVCE hackathon, this project simplifies dataset creation for computer vision. Using Firebase for storage and Django for the backend, authenticated users can annotate images to earn incentives. Annotations are stored for training models, with a simple HTML and CSS frontend for interaction.
